When there is no data available, you show alert and then loading indicator - the UI is blank. 
Especially for right after login this is a problem because UI is blank. You should rather show a blank rounded box 
with dates and Prev and Next (No menu). If the same condition happens on click of Next etc - you should show the alert,
set isLoading false and show the current selected week's UI

The tab menu icons and probably canva may have license
