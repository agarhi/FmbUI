When there is no data available, you show alert and then loading indicator - the UI is blank. 
Especially for right after login this is a problem because UI is blank. You should rather show a blank rounded box 
with dates and Prev and Next (No menu). If the same condition happens on click of Next etc - you should show the alert,
set isLoading false and show the current selected week's UI

The tab menu icons and probably canva may have license 



1. When there are less than 6 (say 2) days of menu set for a week, the main content area is really small
2. For 7 days, the main content area is too long and spaced
3. verticalTabArr is set without useState. Right now it works but not sure how
4. Sign up in one scenario gives you ‘Modal closed’ alert at least on web
5. ITS should be unique
6. Implement the concept of session. You should be sending session id in request instead of userid. This is because someone could authenticate using a different user and perform POST using another user.
7. Error handling (send some crappy value e.g. {"userId":1,"menuId":42, "offset":0,"size":item.value} and loading never stops. The error does propagate to UI but you don’t handle it there
8. Remove readOnly from Menu object
9. Addr2 is required
10. Waiting for raza should be incorporated with login flow 
* Access token expired scenario handle
